The goal of this project is to build and evaluate multiple classification models on a sample dataset, including:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
You will find scripts for:

Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing
Model training and evaluation
Visualizing model performance using Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
A Power BI report for interactive visual exploration of the results
Also I use Jupyter notebook too
